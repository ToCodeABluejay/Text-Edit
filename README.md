# Text-Edit
A small Curses-based text editor written in C

It is currently without a name as I could not think of a good, unique codename for this project, but yet can still do the job.

P.s. I took the inspiration for the UI from the MikeOS text editor. It would be unfair to not give credit. You can find the MikeOS project, written entirely in x86 assembly and BASIC, and distributed under a similar BSD-type license here:
