# Text-Edit
A small Ncurses-based text editor written in C

This project is stil VERY much in its infancy, and still has a very long way to go. Currently, this application has the ability to initialize and re-initialize Ncurses as necessary, and can successfully open files. However, it is not yet able to print file contents to the Ncurses console, nor navigate around said console, or edit the content in any way. It does not yet support necessary functions for saving the files, or the ability to call the function necessary to open a file from the console. In essence, it is very far from even a Beta release, and needs a hell of a lot of work in order to get where it needs to be.

P.s. I took the inspiration for the UI from the MikeOS text editor. It would be unfair to not give credit. You can find the MikeOS project, written entirely in x86 assembly and BASIC, and distributed under a similar BSD-type license here:
